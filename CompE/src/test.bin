# Simple program to test add, lw, sw, and ecall
addi x1, x0, 42      # x1 = 42
addi x2, x0, 10      # x2 = 10
add  x3, x1, x2      # x3 = x1 + x2 (52)
sw   x3, 0(x0)       # Store x3 in memory at address 0
lw   x4, 0(x0)       # Load value from memory address 0 into x4
ecall                # Terminate program
